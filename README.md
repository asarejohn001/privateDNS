# Private DNS
Implementation and Configuration of Private DNS in Azure.

# About the lab
In this hands-on lab, I worked as an Azure network engineer for Big Ben Corporation, a company that specializes in fabricating high-tech watches. I’ve been asked to create a private DNS zone in Azure to allow connectivity to a virtual machine. To do so, I’ll use Azure Private DNS to create a private DNS record to connect to a virtual machine via a domain name.
